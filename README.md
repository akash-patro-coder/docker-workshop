# NYC Yellow Taxi Data Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview
A containerized, end-to-end data ingestion pipeline that loads large-scale NYC Yellow Taxi trip data into PostgreSQL using Python and Docker.

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- pgAdmin
- GitHub Codespaces

## Pipeline Functionality
- Downloads NYC Yellow Taxi public datasets
- Processes large files using memory-efficient chunk-based loading
- Loads data into PostgreSQL tables
- Enables SQL-based analytical and validation queries

## Responsibilities & Contributions
- Designed and implemented a Python-based ingestion service for NYC Yellow Taxi datasets
- Implemented chunk-based data loading to handle large files without memory issues
- Containerized the ingestion workflow using Docker for reproducible execution
- Orchestrated PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and ingestion services using Docker Compose
- Connected Python applications to PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
- Performed SQL-based data validation and analytical queries
- Used GitHub Codespaces to overcome local system and performance limitations
- Followed Data Engineering Zoomcamp best practices for production-style pipelines

## Outcome
Successfully ingested and analyzed 2021 NYC Yellow Taxi trip data, demonstrating practical data engineering skills in data ingestion, orchestration, and analytics.
